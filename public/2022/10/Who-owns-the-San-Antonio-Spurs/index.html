      Who owns the San Antonio Spurs

        <h1 id="Who-owns-the-San-Antonio-Spurs"><a href="#Who-owns-the-San-Antonio-Spurs" class="headerlink" title="Who owns the San Antonio Spurs?"></a>Who owns the San Antonio Spurs?</h1><p>The San Antonio Spurs are a professional basketball team based in San Antonio, Texas. They are part of the Western Conference of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The owner of the Spurs is Peter Holt.</p>
<h1 id="How-did-the-San-Antonio-Spurs-come-to-be-owned-by-Peter-Holt"><a href="#How-did-the-San-Antonio-Spurs-come-to-be-owned-by-Peter-Holt" class="headerlink" title="How did the San Antonio Spurs come to be owned by Peter Holt?"></a>How did the San Antonio Spurs come to be owned by Peter Holt?</h1><p>Peter Holt is the owner of the San Antonio Spurs. He and his wife, Julianna Hawn Holt, are the primary owners of the team. The Holt family has a long history with the Spurs. Peter’s father, Red, was a minority owner of the team from 1977 until his death in 1999.</p>
<p>Peter and Julianna had been longtime fans of the Spurs before they purchased the team. They attended many games and were impressed with the way the organization operated. They felt that the Spurs were a well-run organization with a great culture and decided to purchase the team in 1996.</p>
<p>Since purchasing the Spurs, Peter has been very involved with the team. He is often seen at games or practices and is always interested in what is going on with the team. He has also been very active in the community, supporting various charities and initiatives.</p>
<p>The Holt family has been an important part of Spurs history for many years and their ownership of the team will continue to make them one of the most successful franchises in NBA history.</p>
<h1 id="What-impact-has-Holt-had-on-the-Spurs-organization"><a href="#What-impact-has-Holt-had-on-the-Spurs-organization" class="headerlink" title="What impact has Holt had on the Spurs organization?"></a>What impact has Holt had on the Spurs organization?</h1><p>The Spurs have been a powerhouse in the NBA for nearly two decades, and much of that success can be attributed to head coach Gregg Popovich and star players like Tim Duncan and Tony Parker. However, one other key ingredient has been the stability of the team’s front office, which has been led by R.C. Buford since 2002.</p>
<p>Buford, who was recently named NBA Executive of the Year, is widely credited with building the Spurs into what they are today. But he would never have been able to do it without the help of general manager Dennis Lindsey, who joined the organization in 1994 and has played a major role in drafting and acquiring players like Duncan, Parker, Manu Ginobili and Kawhi Leonard.</p>
<p>However, one person who is often overlooked is assistant general manager Sean Marks, who has played an important role in both scouting and player development. Marks first joined the Spurs as a player in 2004, but he didn’t make the move to the front office until 2012.</p>
<p>Since then, he’s been responsible for drafting players like Davis Bertans and Dejounte Murray, as well as signing international free agents like Patty Mills and Marco Belinelli. He’s also been crucial in developing players like Leonard and Murray into stars.</p>
<p>Overall, the Spurs organization has had a huge impact on the NBA. They’ve set a new standard for how teams should be run both on and off the court, and their many successes have inspired other teams to emulate their model.</p>
<h1 id="What-do-the-Spurs-have-that-other-teams-don’t"><a href="#What-do-the-Spurs-have-that-other-teams-don’t" class="headerlink" title="What do the Spurs have that other teams don’t?"></a>What do the Spurs have that other teams don’t?</h1><p>The San Antonio Spurs have won five championships since 1999, more than any other team in the NBA. What is it that makes them so successful?</p>
<p>There are a few things that stand out about the Spurs. First, they have a great system that their players buy into. Coach Gregg Popovich is one of the best coaches in the league, and he has instilled a team-first mentality in his players. They also have a strong culture and homegrown players who are committed to the team. Finally, they have great ownership that is willing to spend money to put a winning team on the court.</p>
<p>The Spurs are able to win even when they’re not at their best because of their great system. Other teams may be able to match them player for player, but no one can beat them when they play as a team.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-the-future-of-the-San-Antonio-Spurs-under-Holt’s-ownership"><a href="#What-is-the-future-of-the-San-Antonio-Spurs-under-Holt’s-ownership" class="headerlink" title="What is the future of the San Antonio Spurs under Holt’s ownership?"></a>What is the future of the San Antonio Spurs under Holt’s ownership?</h1><p>The San Antonio Spurs have been one of the most consistent franchises in all of professional sports under the ownership of Peter Holt. Holt took over as owner in 1996 and the Spurs have only had three coaches during that time (Gregg Popovich, Bob Hill, and Mike Brown). In that time, they have won five NBA championships and had only one losing season.</p>
<p>Now that Holt is stepping down as owner, what is the future for the Spurs? Popovich is still under contract for two more seasons and will likely continue to coach the team. The roster is also relatively young with Kawhi Leonard, LaMarcus Aldridge, and Tony Parker all in their prime.</p>
<p>There are a few potential successors to Holt as owner but it is unclear who will take over. One possibility is current San Antonio businessman and former senator Carlos Uresti. Another possibility is Julianna Hawn Holt, Peter’s wife who has been involved in many philanthropic endeavors in San Antonio.</p>
<p>Whoever ends up taking over as owner of the Spurs, they will have big shoes to fill. Under Holt’s ownership, the Spurs have been one of the most successful franchises in all of professional sports.</p>
