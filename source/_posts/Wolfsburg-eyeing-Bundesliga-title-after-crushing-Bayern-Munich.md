#  Wolfsburg eyeing Bundesliga title after crushing Bayern Munich

Wolfsburg stunned Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich with a crushing 3-0 victory to open up a seven-point lead at the top of the table.

Dieter Hecking’s men were sensational, scoring three times in the first half through Daniel Caligiuri, Maximilian Arnold and Bas Dost.

Bayern had no response to Wolfsburg’s intense pressing and clinical attacking play, and the result will go a long way to convincing many that the Wolves are serious title contenders this season.

“We played an outstanding game today – it was by far our best performance of the season so far,” said Hecking after the match.

“Bayern are an incredibly strong side, but we managed to take control of the match early on and never looked back. We showed today that we are a real force to be reckoned with in the Bundesliga this season.”

 Wolfsburg now have 24 points from 10 matches, while Bayern are second on 17 points.

#  Wolfsburg dismantle Werder Bremen to stay in title hunt

Wolfsburg produced an emphatic display as they dismantled Werder Bremen 5-0 to stay in the hunt for the Bundesliga title.

The home side were ruthless in their attacking play, with goals from Vieirinha, Bas Dost, Julian Draxler, Ricardo Rodriguez and Maximilian Arnold sealing a comfortable win.

Werder Bremen barely created a chance throughout the match, with their defence being completely overrun by Wolfsburg’s attacking threat.

This was a vital win for Wolfsburg, who have now reduced the gap between themselves and league leaders Bayern Munich to four points.

They will be looking to keep up the pressure on Bayern in their remaining fixtures and maintain their title challenge.

#  Wolfsburg extend Bundesliga unbeaten run with win over Bayer Leverkusen

Bundesliga leaders Wolfsburg extended their unbeaten run in Germany's top flight to 12 games with a 3-1 win over Bayer Leverkusen on Saturday.

The Wolves, who remain two points clear of second-placed Borussia Dortmund, took an 11th minute lead at the Volkswagen Arena when Maximilian Arnold finished off a well-worked team move.

Leverkusen drew level in the 34th minute when Javier Hernandez chested down Sidney Sam's cross and volleyed past goalkeeper Diego Benaglio, but Wolfsburg regained the lead six minutes later when Bas Dost poked home from close range.

Dost added his second goal of the game in the 71st minute to seal all three points for Dieter Hecking's side and ensure that they ended 2014 with an impressive record of 10 wins and two draws from their 12 Bundesliga matches.

Elsewhere on Saturday, Schalke 04 came from behind to beat Hamburger SV 2-1, Hertha Berlin moved up to fourth with a 3-0 win over FC Augsburg, and Eintracht Frankfurt drew 1-1 with Werder Bremen.

#  Wolfsburg take control of Bundesliga with win over Hoffenheim

Wolfsburg reasserted their control of the Bundesliga with a 3-0 win over Hoffenheim. Goals from Mario Gomez, Luiz Gustavo and Ivan Perisic saw the Wolves move seven points clear at the top of the table, and into touching distance of their first league title in 15 years.

“It was an important win, one that keeps us on course for our objectives,” Gomez said after the match. “We want to be Bundesliga champions and we’re taking things one step at a time. We know that we still have work to do but it was important to win today.”

The hosts started brightly and took the lead midway through the first half when Gomez headed home from a corner. The goal seemed to settle Wolfsburg and they began to dominate proceedings, with Perisic going close soon afterwards. Hoffenheim offered very little going forward and it was no surprise when Gustavo doubled Wolfsburg’s lead early in the second half with a well-taken finish from ten yards out.

Perisic added a third late on with a superb long-range strike which gave Koen Casteels no chance in the Hoffenheim goal. The result sees Wolfsburg move seven points clear at the top of the table, while Hoffenheim remain in 12th position, just four points above the relegation play-off spot.

#  Gundogan inspires Dortmund comeback to end Wolfsburg's perfect start

Borussia Dortmund twice came from behind to beat Wolfsburg 3-2 at the Volkswagen Arena and maintain their perfect start to the Bundesliga season.

Dortmund had to come from behind twice in a game for the first time in their Bundesliga history, as goalscorers Marcel Schmelzer and Henrikh Mkhitaryan cancelled out efforts from Daniel Caligiuri and Bas Dost.

The result means Dortmund join Bayern Munich at the top of the Bundesliga table, while Wolfsburg remain in fourth place.

Dortmund started brightly and almost took the lead inside two minutes, but Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's close-range strike was correctly ruled out for offside.

Wolfsburg then took control of proceedings and deservedly took the lead in the 23rd minute through Caligiuri, who drilled a left-footed shot past Roman Weidenfeller from just outside the penalty area.

It was 2-0 to Wolfsburg four minutes into the second half, as Dost finished off a well-worked move by converting Kevin De Bruyne's cross at the back post.

However, Dortmund refused to give up and got back into the game through Schmelzer in the 57th minute, with the left-back finishing clinically after good work by Ilkay Gundogan.

Mkhitaryan then equalised for Dortmund in the 74th minute, firing home after being played through by Shinji Kagawa.

And it was Gundogan who proved to be the hero for Dortmund in stoppage time, scoring with a superb free-kick to seal an impressive comeback victory for Jurgen Klopp's side.
