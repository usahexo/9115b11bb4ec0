Dolores Del Rio was born on August 3, 1905, in San Francisco, California. Raised in a strict Catholic family, she had 13 children by three different husbands. She started her professional acting career in 1922 and was considered one of Hollywood's most beautiful women.

On the night of September 16, 1934, Dolores attended the premiere of her latest movie "The Widow from Monte Carlo" at the Carthay Circle Theater in Los Angeles. After the movie, she and a group of friends went to a nightclub called Trocadero in downtown LA. They drank and danced the night away until 5am.

When they were finally ready to leave, Dolores and her friends piled into two cars for the drive back to her home in Beverly Hills. The first car made it all the way there without incident. But when Dolores' car reached the driveway, it hit a large rock and stopped working.
