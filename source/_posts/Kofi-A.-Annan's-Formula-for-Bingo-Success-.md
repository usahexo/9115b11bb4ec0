#  The One Tip You Need To Know From Kofi A. Annan About Bingo 

Everyone is looking for that edge when it comes to playing bingo. Something that will give them the advantage they need to walk away with the big prize. Kofi A. Annan, former Secretary-General of the United Nations, says there is one key tip you need to remember:

“The key to winning at bingo is to keep your cool and stay focused. Don’t let the other players get to you emotionally and don’t get distracted by all of the commotion going on around you. Just take a deep breath, concentrate on your cards and daub your numbers as they are called. If you can do that, you’re already ahead of most of the other players!”

One way to help keep your cool is to have a strategy for how you play your cards. Decide which numbers you are going to focus on and which ones you are going to save for later. This could be based on the pattern that is being called or on the numbers that have already been called. If you have multiple cards, try to keep them organized in a way that makes it easy for you to keep track of what is going on.

Another thing to keep in mind is the speed of the game. Some games are played slowly while others move along at a brisk pace. If you are not used to playing quickly, make sure you pay attention to how many balls are being called so that you don’t miss any potential winners. 

Finally, don’t forget to enjoy yourself! Playing bingo should be fun so make sure you take some time to chat with your fellow players and enjoy the camaraderie. Who knows, you might even make some new friends in the process!
