#  What is a player?

In the context of video gaming, a player is someone who controls one or more in-game characters. Players typically interact with the game by issuing commands to their characters.

Most video games allow for a certain amount of flexibility in how players can control their characters. For example, a player may be able to move their character around the game world and interact with objects, or they may be restricted to issuing specific commands to their character.

Some games, known as "god games", give players control over almost all aspects of the game world. In contrast, other games, sometimes called "runner games", place very strict limitations on what a player can do. 

The majority of video games allow for online multiplayer gameplay, in which multiple players control their own characters and collaborate or compete with each other to achieve various goals. Multiplayer games have become increasingly popular in recent years, as Internet speeds have increased and bandwidth has become less expensive.

#  How did Liberia become a player in the online gaming industry?

The origins of Liberia’s video game industry can be traced back to the early 1990s, when a few enterprising individuals took advantage of the global reach of the internet to start exporting Liberian-made games to other parts of the world. At first, this nascent industry was hardly noticed by the authorities in Monrovia, who were more preoccupied with rebuilding the country after years of civil war.

It was not until the early 2000s that Liberia started to see significant growth in its video game industry, as a new generation of entrepreneurs and developers began taking advantage of new platforms and technologies such as console gaming and mobile apps. This led to the emergence of several successful gaming companies, including Greenlight Games and Punchline Games, both of which are based in Monrovia.

Today, the video game industry is one of Liberia’s most thriving sectors, accounting for millions of dollars in revenue each year. The country has also become a major player in the global gaming market, with several popular games being developed there, including “Eve Online” and “Black Desert Online”.

So how did Liberia become such a powerhouse in the video game industry? There are several factors that have contributed to this success, including:

1. A Pro-business Environment:Liberia has been consistently ranked as one of the most pro-business countries in Africa due to its stable political environment, low taxes and business-friendly regulations. This has helped create a conducive environment for investment in the video game industry, with entrepreneurs and developers feeling confident about starting up their own businesses.

2. A Diverse Talent Pool: Liberia has a large population (4 million people) and a very diverse culture, which has resulted in a well-educated workforce with strong technical skillsets. This pool of skilled labor is perfect for developing video games, as it allows companies to find talent that is specific to their needs.

3. A Strong Gaming Culture:Gaming is hugely popular in Liberia, with almost everyone playing some type of game on their phone or computer. This love for gaming has helped fuel the development of new games and increase demand for them locally and internationally.
