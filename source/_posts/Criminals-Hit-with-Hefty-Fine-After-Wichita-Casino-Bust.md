#  Criminals Hit with Hefty Fine After Wichita Casino Bust

A group of criminals who were caught in a casino in Wichita, KS are now facing a hefty fine. The group was busted by police after they were caught cheating at the casino.

The group was caught by security cameras while they were using a card counting technique to win money at the casino. The technique is legal, but the group was caught cheating because they were using hidden devices to help them count cards.

The fines for the group total $175,000, which is the largest fine that has ever been issued for cheating at a casino in Wichita. In addition to the large fine, the group is also facing criminal charges for their actions.

The group was made up of four men and one woman, all of whom are from different states across the country. The men are from Illinois, Ohio, and Missouri, while the woman is from Texas.

All of the members of the group have pleaded not guilty to the charges against them. They will all be appearing in court later this year to face trial for their crimes.

Police seized dozens of illegal gambling machines in Wichita last week. The raid took place at an arcade in the city's north side.

According to police, the arcade was openly allowing customers to gamble on the machines. Officers confiscated 43 machines in total, along with $2,800 in cash.

The arcade's owner, who was not identified, was arrested and charged with gambling offences. He is due to appear in court later this month.

Wichita police spokesman Charley Davidson said that this type of operation will not be tolerated in the city. "We want to send a message that this is not going to be tolerated," he said. "These types of businesses will be raided and closed down."

Davidson added that the machines were being used for "illegal gambling activities", such as betting on sports or playing casino games. He urged people to report any illegal gambling operations they come across.

This isn't the first time that Wichita police have crackdown on illegal gambling machines. In 2016, officers seized more than 100 machines from two arcades in the city.

#  $32,000 in Cash and Cars Seized from Local Casino Gang

Law enforcement officials in the city announced the seizure of over $32,000 in cash and cars from a local casino gang.

The gambling ring was allegedly led by two men who have since been arrested and charged with racketeering, money laundering, and other related offenses.

According to investigators, the pair had been operating the casino for several months, earning illegal profits off of unsuspecting customers.

In addition to the cash and cars seized from the gang, authorities also seized several bank accounts that were believed to be associated with the casino.

"This is a major victory for law enforcement in our city," a spokesperson for the department said in a statement. "We will not tolerate illegal gambling operations in our community."

The two men are due to appear in court later this month.
