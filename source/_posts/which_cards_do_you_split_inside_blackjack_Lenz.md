# Which Cards Do You Split in Blackjack? Tips from Lenz

Eric Lenz is a professional blackjack player known for his expertise in the game. One of the most important strategies in blackjack is knowing when to split your cards. Splitting your cards can increase your chances of winning, but it can also lead to greater losses if not done correctly. In this article, we will explore some key tips from Lenz on which cards to split in blackjack.

## Understanding the Basics of Splitting

Splitting is an option in blackjack that is available when the player is dealt two cards of the same rank, such as two 8s or two aces. The player can then choose to split the hand into two separate hands, each with its own bet. The player can then play each hand separately and try to beat the dealer with both hands.

## Tips for Splitting in Blackjack

1. Always split aces: According to Lenz, splitting aces is always the right decision in blackjack. This is because aces are the most powerful card in the deck and splitting them gives you the best chance of getting a strong hand.

2. Split eights against weak dealer cards: Lenz suggests splitting eights when the dealer has a weak up card, such as a 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. This is because the dealer is more likely to bust with these cards and splitting eights gives you a chance to improve your hand.

3. Never split fives or tens: Lenz advises against splitting fives or tens in blackjack. This is because a hand with two fives has a total value of 10, which is a strong hand in blackjack. Similarly, a hand with two tens has a total value of 20, which is an even stronger hand. Splitting these cards would weaken your hand and reduce your chances of winning.

4. Consider splitting other cards in specific situations: In some situations, it may be advantageous to split other cards, such as twos, threes, and sevens. For example, if the dealer has a weak up card and you have a pair of twos or threes, splitting the hand can improve your chances of winning.

## Conclusion

Knowing which cards to split in blackjack is an important strategy for increasing your chances of winning. By following key tips from Lenz on when to split your cards, you can make more informed decisions and feel more confident at the table. However, it is important to remember that gambling can be addictive and should be approached responsibly. With insights from Lenz, you can take your blackjack skills to the next level and become a more successful and knowledgeable player.
