#  Chicago Bulls Lose Again, Costing Fans Money

The Chicago Bulls lost another game on Monday night, this time to the Milwaukee Bucks. The loss means that the Bulls will not make the playoffs, costing fans their money. In response to the news, some fans are calling for a refund.

The Bulls have been struggling all season, and many fans were hoping that they would at least make it to the playoffs. Unfortunately, that will not be the case. The Bucks ended up winning 108-89, and now the Bulls are officially out of contention.

For many fans, this is a huge disappointment. Not only did they waste their time and money by rooting for a losing team, but they will also be refunds. Some people are already calling for the team to give back all of the money that they have collected from ticket sales this season.

It is unclear whether or not the Bulls will actually do this. However, it is clear that they are in a difficult position right now. With so many people calling for refunds, it is going to be hard for them to keep everyone happy.

One thing is for sure: the Bulls are in trouble right now. They have disappointed their fans once again, and it remains to be seen what will happen next.

#  NBA Odds: Chicago Bulls Will Continue to Lose Money

The Chicago Bulls have had a tough season and things don't look like they will get much better. In fact, the Bulls are one of the worst teams in the NBA this year and that is reflected in the NBA odds.

The Bulls have consistently been one of the worst teams against the spread this year. They are 10-24-1 overall and 3-12-1 on the road. The Bulls are also 1-5 against the spread in their last six games.

Some of this can be attributed to the fact that they are without superstar guard Jimmy Butler, who is out with a knee injury. But even when Butler was healthy, the Bulls were not a very good team. They have no real stars on their roster and simply do not have enough talent to compete with the best teams in the league.

There is no reason to think that things will improve for the Bulls anytime soon. They are likely to miss out on the playoffs and they will likely continue to lose money for their bettors.

#  Betting Against the Chicago Bulls is a Money-Making Proposition

The 2017-2018 NBA season has been a roller coaster for the Chicago Bulls. They have had their share of highs and lows, but as the season winds down, they are on the upswing.

Despite this fact, betting against them is still a smart proposition.

On the whole, the Bulls are a below-average team. They rank 16th in the league in offensive rating and 22nd in defensive rating. Additionally, they have struggled with consistency all season long.

They have only won more than two games in a row four times all season long and have lost more than three games in a row six times.

Against such an inconsistent team, betting against them makes sense. The odds are usually in favor of the favorite and when taking into account how poor the Bulls have been this season, that makes betting against them an even wiser decision.

There is value to be found when betting against them, especially as the playoffs near and teams begin to ramp up their play. Betting against Chicago is a money-making proposition this season.

#  Chicago Bulls Fans Continue to Lose Money Betting on Team

Despite their high expectations, the Chicago Bulls have once again failed to deliver a championship caliber season. This has not stopped Bulls fans from continuing to place bets on the team, however, as they continue to lose money in the process.

According to recent data released by the Nevada Gaming Control Board, Bulls fans have lost over $1 million in casino bets since the beginning of the season. This is particularly troubling for those who continue to place bets on the team, as their record currently stands at just over .500.

There is no doubt that the expectations for this Bulls team were high, given their offseason acquisitions. However, injuries and inconsistent play have led to a disappointing season so far. This has not stopped some bettors from continuing to wager on them however, as they believe that they still have a chance at making a run in the playoffs.

Whether or not the Bulls can turn things around remains to be seen, but it is clear that betting on them has not been profitable so far this season. For those who are looking to place bets on the NBA playoffs, it may be wise to look elsewhere, as the Bulls are not likely to win it all this year.

#  Sports Fans in Chicago continue to lose money betting on the Bulls

The Chicago Bulls have been a huge disappointment this season and it has shown in the amount of money the fans in Chicago have lost betting on them. The Bulls started the season with high expectations but have failed to live up to them. This was obvious in their game against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Wednesday night.

The Thunder came into the game as one of the best teams in the league, while the Bulls were one of the worst. The odds reflected that, with Oklahoma City being favored by 7 points. But Chicago managed to pull off the upset, winning 119-112. This was just another example of how the Bulls have let their fans down this season.

Chicago is now 17-30 on the season and they are not going to make the playoffs. This is a team that was supposed to be competing for a championship this year, but now they are fighting just to stay out of last place in their division. It has been a frustrating season for everyone involved and that frustration has shown through in the betting results.

According to ESPN, Chicago sports fans have lost over $1 million betting on the Bulls this season. That is an alarming number and it is no surprise that so many fans are frustrated with how things have gone this year. The good news for those fans is that there is still time for things to turn around.

The Bulls still have plenty of games left this season and they could easily get into playoff contention if they start playing better basketball. They also have some talented players on their roster, including Jimmy Butler and Dwyane Wade. If those players can start playing up to their potential, then the Bulls could be a dangerous team in the playoffs.

But until that happens, Chicago sports fans should avoid betting on them. The odds are not in their favor and they are likely to continue losing money if they keep betting on this team.
